# L10N-Tamer
> Tame your Localizations

Browser based localization management software. Lion Tamer is free and open source and aims to be as simple as possible 
to deploy and host yourself. Allowing projects of any size to bring community driven or professional translation to your site or application. 

# Dev

#### Local Development

- Cd in to frontend folder
- run `yarn dev` to start the development server and hot reloading.
- go to http://localhost:3000/
- Default user to log in is:
  - Username: `admin`
  - tPassword: `password`

#### Other Helpful Commands to know about

- run `yarn build` to build the application as if it were ready for deployment. (This is run in production).
- run `yarn start` to start the built application as if it were ready for deployment. (This is run in production).
- run `yarn lint` to lint the application and check for errors.
- run `yarn type-check` to type check the application using Typescript.
- run `yarn prettier` to format all the code in the application to a specific standard. (This should probably run on pre-commit).


# Ideas
### Variable Substitution
This feature allows the user to substitute an already existing translation into a new translation 
by wrapping the variable in `{}` it will then use the substitute the variable with the translation.
